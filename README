Fireflies is an experiment I built to learn some basic AI around emergent patterns. 

The basic premise is to simulate a swarm of fireflies dancing around a grid with 
each starting at a random point within their lit/unlit cycles. A given dot will
observe the state of it's neighbors to determine if a majority are in opposition 
to it's current state. If so, it will incrementally adjust it's own cycle (phase
decay) to wait for the others. The goal is to find an algorithm that let's the 
group emerge into fully synchronized light cycles.

The project is built in Ruby and uses the Gosu graphics library to simulate the fireflies visualization.
